## Amiga 1000 and Amiga A1010 3.5" Gotek Drive Mount STL File

This was created to give the gotek a stealth look in the Amiga 1000 and 1010 drive when printing with a matching color. No cutting or case modification is needed. In fact with no USB key installed, the case looks stock at first. If you get a slim nano type drive, it is very stealth when in use.

These directions and STL file are provided as is, and no responsibility is assumed on the fitness of the directions or any other information provided.
